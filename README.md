# hpp-leak-rework
A rework of the three versions of leaked hpp cheats for Counter-Strike 1.6.

# Three version of the cheats
There are three versions of the cheat. Each version is older from the other one.
The files are named from the oldest to the newest version as 0-1-2. 2 being the newest.

# Injection
There is a injector included, which you can use to inject.

# Building
Each cheat version has it's solution prepared to build. You need to build the project by yourself. There should be no compile errors if you use c++20, v142 toolset and windows SDK 10.0.
Loaders aren't supposed to be compiled, I didn't even test them.

# DISCLAIMER
THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IT WAS MADE ONLY FOR CODE STUDY AND NOT FOR PLAYING OR USING THE CHEATS! THE CHEATS ARE UNSTABLE, MEANING THAT THEY ARE CRASHING OFTEN!
THIS PROJECT IS A PUBLIC DOMAIN AND YOU CAN USE THIS AND MODIFY AS YOU WISH FOR YOUR NEEDS.
