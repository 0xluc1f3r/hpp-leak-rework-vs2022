# hpp-leak-rework-vs2022
A rework of the three versions of leaked hpp cheats for Counter-Strike 1.6.

# Three version of the cheats
There are three versions of the cheat. Each version is older from the other one.
The files are named from the oldest to the newest version as 0-1-2. 2 being the newest.
0 is HPP v5, 2 is HPP V6, not sure what 1 is, but its an updated version of v5 it seems.

# Injection
There is a injector included, which you can use to inject.

# Building
Each cheat version has it's solution prepared to build. You need to build the project by yourself. There should be no compile errors if you use c++20, v142 toolset and windows SDK 10.0.
Loaders aren't supposed to be compiled, I didn't even test them.

NOTE: MinHook was updated for building with Visual Studio 2022.
